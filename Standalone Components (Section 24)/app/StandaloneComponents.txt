Components, directives, and pipes can now be marked as "standalone: true". Angular classes marked as standalone do not need to be declared in an NgModule (the Angular compiler will report an error if you try).

Standalone components specify their dependencies directly instead of getting them through NgModules. For example, if PhotoGalleryComponent is a standalone component, it can directly import another standalone component ImageGridComponent:

imports can also be used to reference standalone directives and pipes. In this way, standalone components can be written without the need to create an NgModule to manage template dependencies.
